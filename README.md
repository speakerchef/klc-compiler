# KLC: KNOB-Lang-Compiler

A from scratch compiler for **KNOB** (**K**ompiled **NOB**) — a statically typed, semicolon delimited language that I'm creating that compiles down to AArch64 assembly: Uses `.knv` as the file extension.

> *Why `.knv` and not `.knb`?*
> Everyone knows the true perfect language prioritizes ergonomics over sensible standards. `v` is easier to hit from the home row than `b`. You're welcome.

## Architecture

```
source.knv → Lexer → Pratt Parser → AST → Codegen → AArch64 ASSEMBLY → clang/ld → executable
```

- **Lexer/Tokenizer** — tokenizes `.knv` source into a stream of typed tokens
- **Parser** — Pratt parser with precedence climbing for expressions, producing an AST.
- **Codegen** — Currently direct AST emission to assembly targeting AArch64 (Apple Silicon / macOS Darwin ABI). (x86_64 support in the future). No LLVM IR or other backends/deps.

## Language features

>KNOB is a fun project of mine still under active construction.

### Keywords (so far)

| Keyword | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `let`   | Const-defaulted variable declaration |
| `mut`   | Mutable variable declaration |
| `exit`  | Exit with an exit code |
| `if`    | Conditional entry |
| `elif`  | Alternate branch |
| `else`  | Fallback branch |
| `while` | Loop while condition true |

### Operators (so far)

| Category | Operators | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Arithmetic | `+` `-` `*` `/` | Standard integer arithmetic (fp later)|
| Power | `**` | Right associative, eg. 2**3 = 8 |
| Comparison | `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | 1 or 0 |
| Logical | `&&` `\|\|` | Boolean logic on truthy/falsy values |
| Bitwise | `&` `\|` `^` | AND, OR, XOR |

### Other Features

- Parenthesized expressions with correct grouping: `(a + b) * (c - d)`
- Scoping with nested blocks and proper variable resolution
- Variables from outer scopes are visible in inner scopes
- Local variables are inaccessible outside their scope
- Nested if/elif/else with arbitrary depth
- While loops with mutable state

### Performance

- KLC currently emits raw, AArch64 assembly code with zero optimization passes or heuristic-based register allocation methods. Even so, KLC is competitive with C using Clang `-O0` while being multiple orders of magnitudes faster than Python (low hanging fruit but I don't care lol). 
Run the benchmark below as a test!

### Example syntax and benchmark for `KLC`. Try to run this! `echo $?` after should give you 153 :D
> Benchmark: 50,000 iterations of popcount, Collatz sequence, GCD, Fibonacci, primality testing, and hash accumulation combined.

#### Results: (M4 Pro MacBook Pro)
|Lang / Compiler | Time | Magnitude |
|----------|------|-----------|
| KNOB (KLC) | 1.63s | - |
| C (Clang) | 0.64s | ~2.5x Faster |
| Python3 | 52.70s | ~32.3x Slower! |
> This benchmark code is a showcase of all currently available features in `KLC`.

## Build & Generate Executable

> **Requires:** CMake, Clang/GCC with C++23 support, AArch64 target (Apple Silicon Mac)

```bash
# Build the compiler
cmake -S . -B build/
cd build
cmake --build .

# Optional: Alias to use `klc` anywhere on your system
alias klc='path/to/klc-compiler/build/klc'

# Generate assembly and executable (MacOS Only for now)
./klc <FILE.knv> <EXEC-NAME> 

# Or if aliased:
klc <FILE.knv> <EXEC-NAME>
```

### Execute

```bash
./executable

# Or benchmark
time ./executable

# Check exit code
echo $?
```
